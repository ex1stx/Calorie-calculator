There u can find two similar files but there is one difference in these files, first 'main.py' that's my first try to create a simple calculator,
second 'main1.py' is an "upgraded" variant where I use a dictionary to reduce the number of lines
All these calculators were created to calculate your basal metabolism and convert it to kJ from kcal
